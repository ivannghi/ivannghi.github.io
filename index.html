          <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Ivan Nghi</strong>. I am a <strong>3rd</strong> year student at <em>Cal Poly</em>,
             originally from <em>Orange County, CA</em>, majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong>.</p>
          <p>
            I have a strong passion for fitness, whether weightlifting, 
            playing basketball, swimming, or even just tracking my nutrition.
            I have recently picked up skating, surfing, and chess as new hobbies, 
            and i'm hoping to get get pretty good haha.</p>
          <p>
            Other than my hobbies, I hope to further my education and learning in <em>programming</em>
            and <em>software development</em>, as it is the field of work that I ultimately want to 
            pursue a career in.
