        <p>I have a strong passion for fitness, whether weightlifting, playing basketball, swimming, or even just tracking my nutrition.</p>
        <p>I have recently picked up skating, surfing, and chess as new hobbies, and i'm hoping to get get pretty good haha.</p>
        <p>Other than my hobbies, I hope to further my education and learning in <em>programming</em> and <em>software development</em>, as it is the field of work that I ultimately want to pursue a career in.</p>
